                    This was software for a science fair project written in python during the 10th grade. The app allows a camera to act as an overhead projector by applying a warping to either a selected or auto-detected area.

                    It has a basic GUI to allow changing some settings and <mark class="highlighted" onmouseover="showtooltipandset('<img src=\'static/img/into.png\' alt=\'testimg\' class=\'fill\'>')">to define an area to warp/ project by 4 corner points.</mark>

                    This was part of a science fair project of me and a friend. This program was made by myself and my friend worked on the harware components.

                    At the time, we often used Microsoft Lens to scan test papers which inspired us to implement it in video form.

                        I see this project as the beginning of everything that follows on this page. This my first time coding anything and it was a huge shock when I made something that actually worked.
                    
                        This is what turned coding into a thing I thought I would never learn into something I could comfortably do to make other things.

                        Digging down the rabbit hole of programming, I found out about more concepts like optimisation (which I did done of), and naming conventions (which I broke like 1000 of), but this set the ceiling even higher for things to learn.

                        We did NOT win anything in this science fair, yet I always remember this as one failure I'm proud of.

                    This project was something that occured completely on a whim, but I'm very glad happened because it taught me that taking risks lead to good outcomes (sometimes). 
                    
                    Going from literally zero coding knowledge to making a somewhat working program gave a great boost of confidence and allowed me to take on harder challenges in the future.

                            This was a lot of fun to work on during my holidays and taught me many new things.

                            Many hidden complexities like: state machines, enemy behaviour, camera mechanics, level design, asset design really surprised me since they aren't usually things you think about while playing a game.

                            I worked on this game during the holidays when I had nothing else to do to pass time, but it was also a great opportunity to learn new things and to scratch a creative itch I had for a while.

                            In a sense, it wansn't the intention to create something novel but to try mimic great works in the past, like how artists study the masters.

                            I chose to use the Unity game engine to help make the game (I googled how to make a game and landed on it). The supported language is C# so all code is written in this.

                            The beginning was simply trying to make an object that could move with WASD.

                            In my introduction to VEX robotics, I learned something - I had no idea how to drive. I wanted to practice but we were limited by the fact that we only have 1 robot and the practice field is reasonably far from where we live.

                            My solution to this was just to download a driving simulator someone else made and use it "this is probably something people make", I thought. I didn't end up finding anything usable so decided to try make my own.

                            The simulator is made in the Unity engine I learned how to use before and works using a game controller to drive the robot around an accurate field. The robot also interacts with Triballs to score them in a goal.

                            Thanks to ... for a blender model of the field perimeter I mashed together with CAD drawings of the field elements supplied by the VEX organisation. Thanks also to my 2 teammates from 3168T for playtesting.

                            This was significant since it was the first "original" idea I had which I was able to create as a useful tool.

                            Here, the end product was the greatest point of satisfaction and I decided leave it at the state where it's useful for virtual driving practice, which it was intended for. 

                            There were also a lot of ideas, like a multiplayer mode, simulating autonomous code, opponent bots run by computer but time is only so plentiful so I left it at that, but they were cool things to think about.

                            Again, the problem was that I wanted a way to practice driving virtually and the easiest solution was to download someone else's product, yet there were none suitable which led me to try make my own.

                            I was reasonably confident that I could make it in a reasonable timeframe coming from working with Unity in the past, so this gave a bit of confidence in things working out.

                            The code is written in C# and I used the Unity engine to handle the rendering and physics. Models were either imported into blender, modified and exported into Unity or created in blender.

                    <p  class="formatted-text">During the holidays, I revisited an old game me and my friends used to play. One important part of the game is the "auction house" which mimics something like ebay. This was a good method to make money in game by buying underpriced items and reselling them, but it is insanely tedious and time-intensive which this program aimed to streamline. The auction house itself is given by Hypixel's api and so information was taken this way. This allowed simple profit calculations to be made if(priceworth) to notify me. The second way is for ongoing bids to see if the bidding price is significantly less than its value.

                    <p  class="formatted-text">During the holidays, I revisited an old game me and my friends used to play. [something something] being able to create "mods" was something I always wanted to do, but having no clue how to do so. After gaining more confidence in my coding abilities, I tried to make one myself. 
                        
                        This was written in Java. One "quality of life" improvement I wanted was while selecting a team to beat the dungeon. This uses apis provided by Hypixel to get information about players who join, looking at stuff like their equiptment, stats, and achievements to determine who to allow join. 
                        Understanding how apis worked previously helped make this process easier.
                        
                        This in general also taught me a lot about reading source code and documentation to get the answers I needed since this was a non-standard thing to be making. [I believe I was the first person to implement a vertical hotbar in that version of Minecraft.

                    I had many grand ideas of the lore, music, more game mechanics like crafting, scavenging, better enemies.

                    I even planned a really tragic animated intro where the pengiun's siblings get kidnapped by some hunters and it chases after them.

                    But allas, the holidays are only so long so I said goodbye to those ideas.

                            This website is my first "real" website I made and it uses basic html, js, and css. Luckily for the existence of Github Pages I didn't need to worry about hosting it myself. 

                            I tried to add minimal interactive elements as to be captivating but not too many to make it confusing. Hopefully the the few demos weren't too laggy...

(this is kind of why things are in tabs)

                         Messing with colour themes was quite fun and you can try them <mark onclick ="chooserandomtheme()" style="color: var(--black-color);cursor: pointer; background-color: var(--hoverless-color);">here</mark>. I didn't add them as some are quite eye-searing.

                            At the time of making these, I never really saw them as "projects" but just something I wanted to make for the sake of it. 

                            Some of these ideas I had long before I actually made them like the Collator and Minecraft mods so being able to revisit these with new skills was really satisfying.
