                    This was part of a science fair project of me and a friend. This program was made by myself and my friend worked on the harware components.

                    At the time, we often used Microsoft Lens to scan test papers which inspired us to implement it in video form.

                        This is what turned coding into a thing I thought I would never learn into something I could comfortably do to make other things.

                        Digging down the rabbit hole of programming, I found out about more concepts like optimisation (which I did done of), and naming conventions (which I broke like 1000 of), but this set the ceiling even higher for things to learn.

                        We did not win anything in this science fair, yet I always remember this as one "failure" I'm proud of.

                        <p class="formatted-text">I wanted to make a platformer game and started by deciding whether to use a game engine and which to use. I figured using an engine would more painless than not and between Unity, Unreal, and Godot I arbitrarily chose Unity. 
                            
                            I began by following a tutorial to add a character and objects, making sure they collide with each other, I then coded the movement controls for the character and added some platforms to jump onto. I then added two basic mechanics to the character which was sliding and attacking. 
                            
                            At this point I felt there should be a proper character sprite so I learned a bit of animation and created walking, jumping, sliding, attacking animations in pixel art. I moved onto designing the first level and did so in a way that all basic controls had to be used to pass, acting like a tutorial. 
                            
                            I then added 3 different enemies along with their animations and attacks and coded their behavior and movement. Naturally, I had to then implement a health system for the player and enemies. I felt it would be nice to track where the player had died before and so I implemented storing recent dead bodies into memory while writing a basic save system and also started on an inventory system. 
                            
                            I finished off by drawing some more art for the background, made everything look a little nicer and added some menus. At this point I paused working on the project.

                        <p class="formatted-text">This is a driving simulator application for the VEX robotics game "Over Under" based on my team's robot. Its intended use is as a tool to practice driving around the specific field and objects relating to the game. Hence, all aspects are made to be as realistic as possible such as: camera angle, feeling of driving, interactions between robot and objects, proportion and physics of objects, and controls of the virtual robot.
                            
                            It uses a game controller e.g. Xbox which closely maps onto the VEX controller to control the robot. Basic robot functionality like extendible arms and an intake for the balls are also present to give a more complete and realistic driving experience.
                            
                            There is the ability to shoot balls onto the field which are used in the real life game to simulate an opponent or teammate trying to score points to practice blocking or scoring techniques.

                            Thanks to user "Sylvie" on vexforums for a blender model of the field perimeter I mashed together with CAD drawings of the field elements supplied by the VEX organisation. Thanks also to my 2 teammates from 3168T for playtesting.

                        <p class="formatted-text">This was significant since it was the first "original" idea I had which I was able to create as a useful tool.

                            Here, the end product was the greatest point of satisfaction and I decided leave it at the state where it's useful for virtual driving practice, which it was intended for. 

                            There were also a lot of ideas, like a multiplayer mode, simulating autonomous code, opponent bots run by computer but time is only so plentiful so I left it at that, but they were cool things to think about.

                            I was reasonably confident that I could make it in a reasonable timeframe coming from working with Unity in the past, so this gave a bit of confidence in things working out.

                            I began first with figuring out the robot should drive and writing the controls for this to mimic the same drive as our real life robot , <mark class="highlighted" onmouseover="showtooltipandset('<img src=\'static/img/vexboxcontroller.png\' alt=\'testimg\' class=\'fill\'>')">a game controller which is similar to the VEX one is used</mark>. I chose to not simulate actual wheels of the robot but made sure the robot could only drive when in contact with a surface. 
                            
                            I then figured out how to import models of the VEX field and components into the environment and scaled them accurately. Then I worked on making the program "feel" realistic by adjusting things like center of mass of the robot, relative mass to the balls, resistance of the goals to balls being pushed in, driving speed, collisions with walls and balls, camera angle to mimic real life. Then, I added more controls to be able to shoot balls onto the field like in the real game (defensive), shoot balls to the opposite side (offensive), and added other components on the robot like the extendible arms and intake to push and grab balls. 
                            
                            Lastly, I worked on smaller details like randomness of the balls shooting, tweaked interactions a little more, and made things look a bit nicer. At this point the program was useable for practice

                    <p  class="formatted-text">It was through this project that I actually learned what an "API" was and how to use it and handle data.

                        Even though this was only inside a video game, I feel that there are large similarities to real life auction sites like eBay (which the game's was based off of) and learning how to utilise APIs in general was a useful tool.

                    <p  class="formatted-text">An objective in the game is to make as much money as possible and reselling undervalued items for a profit was a very efficient way to do so. I sought to automate the process of manually looking through auctions and judging their profit margins.

                    <p  class="formatted-text">I began by first figuring out how the auction house API worked and how to retrieve data from it. Handling this was relatively painless thanks to using python. 

                        Then, I needed a way to calculate the profit of every item and filter for the most profitable options. For "bidding" auctions this was done by subtracting the current bid by the mean of 5 lowest sales for that particular item which was stored in a list for faster reference in repeated items. Auctions far from the ending time generally have price no where near the price it would end at so I only considered those ending in less than 15 mins.
                        
                        I then created a way to view these auctions outside of the terminal and it would send a ping sound when a profitable auction was detected. 
                        
                        I then realised that I would have to always be near my computer to not miss any items which is less than ideal so I found a way to also send a notification to my phone of the auction.

                        One feature is when a player joins, checking with the game's API their information e.g high scores, equipment to determine whether they are "worthy" or not to join a party. 

                        When playing the game, the time to complete different stages is tracked and displayed in a corner to give feedback on performance. Other metrics like how much each player contributed is also tracked automatically and displayed at the end of each game.

                        There are also more miscellaneous features e.g automatically sending a status message when performing a specific action.

                        Code is written by myself but I read through the code of mods like "NotEnoughUpdates", "Skytils", "DungeonRoomsMod" and many others so my thanks goes out to their respective creators.

I also found the learning and making process itself to be enjoyable and often switched between actually playing the game and working on coding the mod.

                        I appreciated being able make use of learning how to use APIs previously and also that making a mod for this game in general was something I always wanted to do when I was much younger

                    <p  class="formatted-text">One problem I encountered while playing the game was the need to check how "good" a new player was when they joined my group and the process I was doing before meant I had to open two different websites, search for the player's name, find the information I was looking for, and trying to do so quickly before people tired of waiting for me.

                        I figured that It should be mostly straightforward to get the information itself, and also to display it inside the game. This saved time and also allowed to filter out less useful information and even automate processes like removing a player if they fell below some threshold for e.g their level.

                    <p  class="formatted-text">I enjoyed the process of flip-flopping between finding some improvement I wanted to make while playing the game, and trying to code the improvement into the mod as it meant I wouldn't run out of ideas.

                        When I would get stuck on figuring out how to implement something, I would read the code of other people making mods for similar purposes, and sometimes I would get lucky and they would be working on the exact same thing as myself. Other times there might have been only loosely related examples that still gave some insight and inspiration on how to solve the problem. 
                        
                        Testing my implementations was extraordinarily easy this time as I would be playing the game either way and so the constant feedback really helped to refine everything.

This was good to just practice using the language and coding the formatting.

                    This game doesnt have a real name (?) I chose a penguin as the character because I like penguins.

                    I had many grand ideas of the lore, music, more game mechanics like crafting, scavenging, better enemies.

                    I even planned a really tragic animated intro where the pengiun's siblings get kidnapped by some hunters and it chases after them.

                    But allas, the holidays are only so long so I said goodbye to those ideas.

                    In my introduction to VEX robotics, I learned something - I had no idea how to drive. I wanted to practice but we were limited by the fact that we only have 1 robot and the practice field is reasonably far from where we live.

                    My solution to this was just to download a driving simulator someone else made and use it "this is probably something people make", I thought. I didn't end up finding anything usable so decided to try make my own.

                    The simulator is made in the Unity engine I learned how to use before and works using a game controller to drive the robot around an accurate field. The robot also interacts with Triballs to score them in a goal.

                    During the holidays, I revisited an old game me and my friends used to play. One important part of the game is the "auction house" which mimics something like ebay. This was a good method to make money in game by buying underpriced items and reselling them, but it is insanely tedious and time-intensive which this program aimed to streamline. The auction house itself is given by Hypixel's api and so information was taken this way. This allowed simple profit calculations to be made and to highlight items worth buying.

                    During the holidays, I revisited an old game me and my friends used to play. Being able to create "mods" was something I always wanted to do but had no clue how to do so. After gaining more confidence in my coding abilities, I tried to make one myself. 
                        
                    This in general also taught me a lot about reading source code and documentation to get the answers I needed since this was a non-standard thing to be making. I believe I was the first person to implement a vertical hotbar in that version of Minecraft.

                    This was my first attempt at designing a website, and although there could definitely be improvements, I'm mostly satisfied with the way it turned out. Making this website, like some of the other projects was a way to learn a new skill, and after making this, I'm a little more confident that I could assemble a similar thing in the future. I originally had the idea of making everything a little cinematic and story-like but I scrapped this idea realizing that it may not have been so appreciated by reviewers, especially in the interest of time. Regardless, making this website portfolio was very enjoyable and especially to reflect on some old projects.

                            This website is my first "real" website I made and it uses basic html, js, and css. Luckily for the existence of Github Pages I didn't need to worry about hosting it myself. 

                            I tried to add minimal interactive elements as to be captivating but not too many to make it confusing. Hopefully the the few demos weren't too laggy...

(this is kind of why things are in tabs)

                         Messing with colour themes was quite fun and you can try them <mark onclick ="chooserandomtheme()" style="color: var(--black-color);cursor: pointer; background-color: var(--hoverless-color);">here</mark>.

                            At the time of making these, I never really saw them as "projects" but just something I wanted to make for the sake of it. 

                            Some of these ideas I had long before I actually made them like the Collator and Minecraft mods so being able to revisit these with new skills was really satisfying.
